# Tests example

This repository contains a simple application which is tested with different types of tests.

## Context

A simple web page wich displays a weather in Warsaw.
The temperature and the weather description is randomly generated on the backend, and the frontend displays it.
The weather description depends on the temperature (e.g. if the temperature is below 20 degrees, the weather description is "cold").

## Tasks

1. Add a feature that translates the weather description based on the browser language;
2. Add a feature that allows the user to change the city.
